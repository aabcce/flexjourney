 * This is a generated sub-class of _JyAttend.as and is intended for behavior

 * of the super-class.

 * NOTE: Do not manually modify the RemoteClass mapping unless
 * your server representation of this class has changed and you've 
 * updated your ActionScriptGeneration,RemoteClass annotation on the
 * corresponding entity
